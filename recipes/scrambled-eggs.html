    <h2>Description</h2>
    I've been tweaking my recipe for a while now and I've finally found the best scrambled eggs ever! My friends and family love it, and I make it almost once a week before school. Perfectly creamy and cheesy scrambled eggs. 
    The perfect dish for breakfast. 

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sliced cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>2 thin slices ham (optional)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Crack eggs into a bowl and whisk together until smooth.</li>
    <li>Add in cheddar cheese, ham, and heavy cream into the mixture and mix well.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Pour in your egg mixture; cook and stir until set but still moist, for roughly 3-5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
