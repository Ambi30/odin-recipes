    <h1>Crispy Honey Sriracha Chicken Wings</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    The honey-sriracha glaze is quite delicious and incredibly simple, but merely an afterthought here. The real star of the show is the strange, but effective, technique of coating the wings with a baking powder-laced spice rub before baking. Through the magic of chemical reactions, the surface of the chicken becomes bone-dry, and eventually crisps up to something very similar to what would come out of a deep fryer.

    This recipe yields 4 servings.
